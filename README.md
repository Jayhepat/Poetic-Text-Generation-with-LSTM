# Poetic-Text-Generation-with-LSTM
This project implements a text generation model using an LSTM neural network in TensorFlow/Keras. It generates poetic text based on a training dataset, such as Shakespeare's plays, and allows you to experiment with different "temperature" values to control the randomness of the generated text.
